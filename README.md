# Simple Twitter Badge

A super-simple [Twitter](http://twitter.com) badge for [WordPress](http://wordpress.org)
blog sidebars.

A mostly built this for myself.  To abstract the Twitter-badge functionality
out of the themes I was otherwise writing.  (A brief history: the badge was
unfortunately built-in to [Ortho](https://github.com/founddrama/ortho), and I
didn't want to make the same mistake with [Orin](https://github.com/founddrama/orin)).

Enjoy.

## Features
* Input your relevant Twitter username
* Displays up to 25 "most recent" tweets

## Limitations
* Alas! only 1 per page (but that's a limit from Twitter's end)
  * (but also: remember: this is the "super-simple" version)
